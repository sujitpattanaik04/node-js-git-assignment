    including branch deletions and checkouts.You can use it to find the commit hash of the deleted branch.

STEPS:

        1. git reflog

B.Recover the Deleted Branch or Specific Commit

    -> Restore the Entire Branch
        1. git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <deleted-branch-commit-hash>

    ->  Restore a Specific Commit using Cherry-pick
        1. git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
        2. git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
