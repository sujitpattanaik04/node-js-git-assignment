* Removing a sensitive file like .env from a Git repository involves two main steps:

    A. Remove the file from the latest commit and prevent it from being included in future commits.
    B. Permanently remove the file from the entire Git history to ensure it is not accessible even from old commits.

        
    A. Adding the .env file to .gitignore to prevent it from being committed again:
    
            echo ".env" >> .gitignore
            git add .gitignore
            git commit -m "Remove .env and add it to .gitignore"



    B. Removing the .env File from the Latest Commit
        1. Remove the.env file from the working directory and index:

            git rm--cached.env

        2. Push the changes to the remote repository:
        
            git push origin main



    C. Removing the .env File from All Old Commits
           
        1. Remove the .env file from all commits:

            git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" HEAD
            
        2. Force-push the rewritten history to the remote reConfirming the File is No Longer Accessible on GitHub repository:
        
            git push origin --force --all
            


* Confirming the File is No Longer Accessible on GitHub:

    ->  Go to your GitHub repository and check the commit history to ensure that the .env file is no longer present.
    ->  Verify that the .env file is no longer accessible by trying to view it from old commits or branches.
